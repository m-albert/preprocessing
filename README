PIPELINE FOR PREPROCESSING MUVI-SPIM DATA
AUTHOR: MARVIN ALBERT (marvin.albert@gmail.com)

input:
    bead files
    data timepoints
    
output:
    (bead alignment parameters)
    fused stack
    
usage:
- define parameters in configuration.py (template with explanations available in main folder)
- run the pipeline:
    linux:
        run execute-linux.sh pathToConfigurationFile
    windows:
        specifiy <pathToConfigurationFile> in execute-windows.bat and execute

dependencies contained in the binary (anaconda python):
1) python 2.6
2) numpy
3) scipy
5) SimpleITK
6) elastix

comments:
- alignment parameters are only calculated once and placed in out/pipe
- approx. 10GB of RAM required for full fusion of 2*2 views
- currently not fully supporting imaging settings other than: 2 opposing cameras and 2 orthogonal rotational views
- further settings regarding the image based alignment are defined in parameterTemplate.txt and initialTransformTemplate.txt

to do:
- save obtained parameters and make them usable for next run (add option to indicate wether to use old params or nor)
- generalize weights for final fusion (only for 0 and 90 degrees at the moment)
- handle case without rotation
- determine exact meaning of convergence criterium in elastix
- write correct meta data to tiff files
- copy data over network while computing (optimize for normal use mode and enable ssh support for cluster queing when directories cannot be mounted) (command line scp client for windows: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)
- dont automatically overwrite
- otsu threshold for bead segmentation
